**About The Repository**

I've joined a bootcamp to have a broader idea on C Programming outside my academic course. 
Ane here in this repository will include all the exercise and those sloving documentation given by the instractor of the bootcamp.
Here all the code is in C Language. 

Note: C is the 1st programming language I'm learning and through which I have entered into my programming career.
